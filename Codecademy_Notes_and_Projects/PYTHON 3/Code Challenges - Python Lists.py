# 1. Append Sum
# Write a function named append_sum that has one parameter — a list named named lst.

# The function should add the last two elements of lst together and append the result to lst. It should do this process three times and then return lst.

# For example, if lst started as [1, 1, 2], the final result should be [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8].

#Write your function here
def append_sum (lst):
  for i in range(3):
    new_element = lst[-2] + lst[-1]
    lst.append(new_element)
  
  return lst

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(append_sum([1, 1, 2]))



# 2. Larger List
# Write a function named larger_list that has two parameters named lst1 and lst2.

# The function should return the last element of the list that contains more elements. If both lists are the same size, then return the last element of lst1.

#Write your function here
def larger_list (lst1, lst2):
  if len(lst1) > len(lst2): 
    return lst1[-1]
  elif len(lst1) < len(lst2): 
    return lst2[-1]
  else:
    return lst1[-1]
#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(larger_list([4, 10, 2, 5], [-10, 2, 5, 10]))



# 3. More Than N
# Create a function named more_than_n that has three parameters named lst, item, and n.

# The function should return True if item appears in the list more than n times. The function should return False otherwise.

#Write your function here
def more_than_n (lst, item, n):
  if lst.count(item) > n:
    return True
  else:
    return False 

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(more_than_n([2, 4, 6, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2], 2, 3))



# 4. Append Size
# Create a function called append_size that has one parameter named lst.

# The function should append the size of lst (inclusive) to the end of lst. The function should then return this new list.

# For example, if lst was [23, 42, 108], the function should return [23, 42, 108, 3] because the size of lst was originally 3.

#Write your function here
def append_size (lst):
  size = len(lst)
  lst.append(size)
  return lst  

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(append_size([23, 42, 108]))



# 5. Combine Sort
# Write a function named combine_sort that has two parameters named lst1 and lst2.

# The function should combine these two lists into one new list and sort the result. Return the new sorted list.

#Write your function here
def combine_sort (lst1, lst2):
  new_list = lst1 + lst2
  new_list.sort()
  return new_list

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
print(combine_sort([4, 10, 2, 5], [-10, 2, 5, 10]))
