# 1. Count Letters

# Write a function called unique_english_letters that takes the string word as a parameter. The function should return the total number of unique letters in the string. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be counted as different letters.

# Weâ€™ve given you a list of every uppercase and lower case letter in the English alphabet. It will be helpful to include that list in your function.

letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Write your unique_english_letters function here:
def unique_english_letters(word):
  count = 0
for letter in letters:
    if letter in word:
      count += 1
  return count
# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
print(unique_english_letters("mississippi"))
# should print 4
#print(unique_english_letters("Apple"))
# should print 4



# 2. Count X 

# Write a function named count_char_x that takes a string named word and a single character named x as parameters. The function should return the number of times x appears in word.
